    <documentation>Interface for the controls which are suitable to shrink.

This means the control should still look fine when it gets smaller than its normal size,
e.g. Text controls which can show ellipsis in case of shrink.

Note: This marker interface can be implemented by controls to give a hint to the container.
The control itself does not need to implement anything. A parent control that respects this interface
will apply the "flex-shrink" as a CSS property which determines how much the item will shrink relative
to the rest of the items in the container when negative free space is distributed.</documentation>
